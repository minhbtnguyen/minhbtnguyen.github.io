  An engineer focused on **production ML systems**—the kind that ship, scale, and stay up.

  Built ML-driven systems across **finance, autonomous systems, startups, and research labs**, with an emphasis on reliability, observability, and long-term maintainability.

  Systems-minded, with a focus on clean architecture and long-term optimization—often found playing pickleball, running marathons, or over a chessboard.
